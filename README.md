In order to compile the engine from source you must have [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/) installed on your system.
After you have done this you can clone the repo by doing this:
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/YaminAhmed123/HATE.git
```
Now you can continue with building

```powershell
cd HATE
meson setup build
cd build
meson compile
```
